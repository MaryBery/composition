Composition

I wrote this website as a way to advertise my works in music composition with the intention to spark interests in clients to request my compositions. 
The navigation bar is a construct of divs and spans to create a piano keyboard that are fixed on the left of the screen, and my photo is fixed on the right of the screen.
The home page carries a brief update of the ongoings in my composition career.
The pieces and mixes pages provide a series of my compositions that are streamed through YouTube.
The about page shows my bio and mission and closes with my composer résumé.
The contact page uses formsubmit.co as a way for clients to contact me.
I wrote this site with a format for vertical smartphones and a format for horizontal smartphones and computers.
I coded it with html, css, and JScript.
