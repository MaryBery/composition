Composition

I wrote this website as a way to advertise my works in music composition with the intention to spark interests in clients to request my compositions. 
It displays my works, my information as a composer, and a way to contact me. 
I wrote this site with a format for vertical smartphones and a format for horizontal smartphones and computers.
I coded it with html, css, and JScript.
